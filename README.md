IBM Broadway ISA Library for Wii Modding

This repository aims to highlight the many configurations of which the Nintendo Wii's hardware pertaining to the CPU
can be used for making modifications to the console.

This is also a great learning experience for me as this will allow me to expand my repertoire and knowledge when
it comes to Low Level machines and Computer Architecture; learning how Assembly works and how to effectively translate
that to a more mutable language
